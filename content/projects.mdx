Implementation of the [Rust Vulkan tutorial](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/introduction.html), to learn Vulkan. In time, I hope to expand this to some sort of engine-playground for experimenting with graphics programming.

<Info title="Features">
- Error checking with validation layers
- A complete render pass and pipeline
- Shader modules
- Vertex buffers, index buffers, staging buffers, uniform buffers, command buffers
- The Vulkan Triangle
- Samplers and textures
- A depth buffer
- OBJ model loading
- Mipmaps
- Multisample antialiasing (MSAA)
- Push constants

OpenGL library to provide common functionality for my graphics programming projects.

<Info title="Details">
The library can be divided in three main parts:

* A (varyingly) thin wrapper over the core OpenGL API to provide a more modern and C++-like interface. This comprises abstractions over render commands, buffer objects, etc.
* An application class that uses GLFW to create a window and manage the OpenGL context, inputs and render loop.
* Utility classes for mesh loading, colors or math wrapping over GLM.

A (very early-stage) 64-bit OS, for fun. Comprised for now almost exclusively of a bootloader written in x86-64 assembly.

<Info title="Details">
The bootloader:
- Sets up the MBR
- Sets up a basic flat-model GDT
- Elevates from real mode to protected mode
- Sets up identity paging
- Elevates from protected mode to long mode
- Calls the `_start()` function in the kernel

Treewalk interpreter for a simple dynamically-typed programming
language, from the first part of the book [*Crafting
Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert
Nystrom, implemented in Rust with some changes along the way.

<Info title="Details">
The program consists of four main parts:

1. A scanner that reads the source code, either from a file or a REPL, and produces a sequence of tokens.
2. A parser that produces an abstract sintax tree from the sequence of tokens.
3. A resolver that performs static analysis on the AST.
4. An interpreter that traverses the AST and executes the code.

The language is expression-based, with dynamic typing, lexical
scoping, local functions, closures and some built-in functions.

An implementation of Austin Morlan's [CHIP-8 emulator](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/) in C++, using SDL2 for input and rendering.

<Info title="Details">
The fetch-decode-execute cycle of the virtual CPU is run using a function pointer table to get each opcode method, and displaying the result on a (scaled) 64x32 screen.
