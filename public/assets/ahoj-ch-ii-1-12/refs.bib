Therefore, it is important to establish the application of radiocarbon dating of tephra layers with high levels of reliability. We have examined the reliability of radiocarbon dating by dating three samples of organic material associated with the Aira-Tn (AT) tephra layer. AT tephra, ≈25,000 14C BP, is one of the major widespread tephras in Japan. We demonstrate that by using detailed pre-treatment on samples, closely examined samples, measurements with higher precision are possible.

Unlike most prehistoric pottery-using peoples, the Jomon people are thought to have been hunter-gatherers. Evidence of plant cultivation does exist, but none of the cultigens recovered from Jomon sites seems to have been used as a staple food resource. High site density, food storage, and long distance trade also characterize this Jomon period. Using ecological models of hunter-gatherer culture and behavior, Habu examines various aspects of Jamon culture including subsistence-settlement, rituals, crafts and trade, and presents a model of long-term change in hunter-gatherer cultural complexity. In this comprehensive analysis, Junko Habu helps to bridge the gap between largely Japanese discourse on this 10,000-year period of Japanese prehistory and the modern scientific debate on later hunter-gatherer societies. It will prove invaluable to students and researchers alike."--Jacket},

The core of the discussion is based on the source determinations for .5*** obsidian artifacts from sites in these two regions. The sourcing results identiﬁed obsidians from ﬁve groups of sources in the Chubu and Kanto districtsῌWadaoSuwa, Tateshina, Kozushima, Hakone and Amagiῌand procurement and utilization of all ﬁve sources in the microblade industries in the same districts. Among these sources, both WadaoSuwa and Kozushima obsidians were identiﬁed in sites over ,** km from the sources, indicating development of wide zones of utilization. Possible strategies for using these sources include direct procurement, trade, and embedding (in seasonal rounds). Which strategy, or strategies, was actually used is not known at this moment. There was a distinct increase in the use of obsidian from the Kozushima source, on an island in the Paciﬁc Ocean, by the microblade industries, compared to earlier phases of the Late Palaeolithic. The microblade-technology revolution for the e\$cient use of lithic resources and the aggressive development of obsidian sources on distant islands reﬂect a strategy of the peoples in the Japanese Islands for adapting to the rapid changes in the environment at the end of the Pleistocene.},

This period corresponds to the early part of the early Upper Palaeolithic (eEUP). To date, similar stone axes have not been reported in Upper Palaeolithic sites in the continental regions of China, Korea, and Russia. These edge-ground axes appear to be independent inventions of the first Homo sapiens to settle the Japanese islands, and they are one manifestation of modern human behavior. The larger edge-ground axes appear to have been used for felling trees and for modifying wood. When the blades were damaged, these axes were reworked into smaller forms and reused for processing hide. The flake tools that were parts of the same lithic assemblages as the axes were probably hunting tools, but presently there is no evidence they were used for hunting the large mammals, such as Naumann’s elephants, that inhabited the Japanese islands at that time. Some of these flake tools were made of obsidian obtained from an island in the Pacific off the coast of Japan, demonstrating these early inhabitants of the Japanese islands had some kind of watercraft for crossing ocean waters. This is also a type of modern human behavior. Further, around 40,000 cal BP there was no land connection between the continent and Japan, so these first Homo sapiens settlers of the islands had to arrive by crossing water. The humans possessing these edge-ground axes formed circular settlements which they inhabited seasonally. They most likely had a clear awareness of group and of cooperative behavior.},

The idea of a continuous shared Japanese culture, often described as "Japanese-ness," is epitomized by material items ranging from Zen Buddhist stone gardens and tea ceremony equipment to such archaeological artifacts as the prehistoric Jomon clay figurines. An Archaeological History of Japan challenges this notion by critically examining archaeological evidence as well as the way it has been interpreted.By combining techniques of traditional archaeological investigation with the tools of contemporary critical sociological and anthropological theory, An Archaeological History of Japan reveals the contingent, reflexive nature of how the prehistoric inhabitants of the Japanese islands identified themselves as they mapped their social and cultural environment. Koji Mizoguchi demonstrates that this process of self-identification underwent transformations as societies and technology changed, indicating that there is no intrinsic connection binding present-day Japanese with people of the past.},

	abstract = {The pattern of latest Pleistocene climate changes reconstructed on the basis of sediment cores from Lake Nojiri is one of the most detailed and reliable reconstructions in Japan. The climate changes over the last 72 ka can be compared directly with those recorded at Upper Paleolithic and Incipient Jomon sites on the basis of a revised age model for the Lake Nojiri sediment cores and the revised 14C dates, calibrated after IntCal09. Fossil bones of megafauna from the Tategahana site beside the lake have been placed ca. 53–37 ka cal BP, in the relatively warm, temperate climate of the early MIS 3. Part of the Tategahana site was interpreted as a kill and butchery site, although the presence of the “big game hunters” is still uncertain, as so far there is no reliable archaeological evidence in the Japanese archipelago dating back to the Middle Paleolithic. The number of Paleolithic sites increased suddenly after 38 ka cal BP around Lake Nojiri. This seems to coincide with the timing of the migration of Homo sapiens into the Japanese archipelago. The climate had been gradually cooling toward the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, the area around Lake Nojiri in the late MIS 3 seems to have been a suitable place for the subsistence of hunter-gatherers. Backed blade industries (ca. 29–20 ka cal BP), point-tool industries (ca. 22–19 ka cal BP), and microblade industries (20–16 ka cal BP) were characteristic of the Late Upper Paleolithic. The number of sites around Lake Nojiri decreased significantly during the LGM. At the end of the LGM, an abrupt change of vegetation, from subarctic conifer forest to deciduous broadleaf forest, had occurred around 14 ka, and human activities became prominent around Lake Nojiri, as shown by the linear-relief pottery group (ca. 15–13 ka cal BP). The number of sites seems to have decreased slightly during the Younger Dyras cooling event. Patterns of human occupation around Lake Nojiri show the influence of global and local climate changes.},

This study addresses the question of the extent to which cultural diffusion played a role in proliferating the innovated early pottery technology across the Japanese Archipelago by employing the distance decay model of cultural diffusion. Based on the assembled dataset of the Late-Glacial assemblages with early pottery radiocarbon dates, distances between the presumed core where the earliest dates were obtained (i.e., Odaiyamamoto I) and the adopted sites do not exhibit the time-progressive pattern. In contrast, frequencies of potsherds relative to lithic artifacts increases as time progressed, implying that early pottery technology was gradually accumulated nearly by the end of the Younger Dryas, ca, 11,000 cal. BP. This study demonstrates that cultural diffusion does not fully explain the emergence and spread of early pottery in Japan, while the Late-Glacial travel and exchange networks enabled hunter-gatherers to transmit and accumulate knowledge of pottery use.},

The phylogenetic analyses support multiple waves of migration, with IK002 forming a basal lineage to the East and Northeast Asian genomes examined, likely representing some of the earliest-wave migrants who went north from Southeast Asia to East Asia. Furthermore, IK002 shows strong genetic affinity with the indigenous Taiwan aborigines, which may support a coastal route of the Jomon-ancestry migration.

	abstract = {A lithic assemblage with edge-ground axes appeared in the Japanese archipelago in MIS3, about 38,000 cal BP, and continued to about 32,000 cal BP. This period corresponds to the early part of the early Upper Palaeolithic (eEUP). To date, similar stone axes have not been reported in Upper Palaeolithic sites in the continental regions of China, Korea, and Russia. These edge-ground axes appear to be independent inventions of the first Homo sapiens to settle the Japanese islands, and they are one manifestation of modern human behavior. The larger edge-ground axes appear to have been used for felling trees and for modifying wood. When the blades were damaged, these axes were reworked into smaller forms and reused for processing hide. The flake tools that were parts of the same lithic assemblages as the axes were probably hunting tools, but presently there is no evidence they were used for hunting the large mammals, such as Naumann’s elephants, that inhabited the Japanese islands at that time. Some of these flake tools were made of obsidian obtained from an island in the Pacific off the coast of Japan, demonstrating these early inhabitants of the Japanese islands had some kind of watercraft for crossing ocean waters. This is also a type of modern human behavior. Further, around 40,000 cal BP there was no land connection between the continent and Japan, so these first Homo sapiens settlers of the islands had to arrive by crossing water. The humans possessing these edge-ground axes formed circular settlements which they inhabited seasonally. They most likely had a clear awareness of group and of cooperative behavior.},

	abstract = {This study reports radiocarbon dates of more than 30 samples of charred residues on pottery sherds of the Incipient Jomon period. The ages of Linear-relief (Ryukisenmon) pottery were 15,300-13,700 cal BP, with great differences among the samples. The pitted decoration (Enkomon), Nail-impressed (Tsumegatamon), and pressing and dragging (Oshibikimon) types date to 13,800-12,400 cal BP. For pottery of the same type, differences among sites were large. At the Unokiminami site, the impressed cord mark (Oatsu Jomon) is the main pottery type, including Nail-impressed. The latter shows a slightly older age. Stable isotope and elemental analyses were used to ascertain the origin of charred residues on the pottery. In the data set of Jomon pottery of the oldest type, residues consisting only of cooked nuts were found. However, Jomon people, even from early times, are thought to have cooked mixed plant and animal ingredients, including marine products.},
